## Useful python tips
- continue means stop and immediately go back to start of loop,  
therefore it can be used to skip certain lines of code

- Lists can have lists in them too e.g [1,2,[4,5],6]

- Strings are "immutable"  i.e it cannot be changed, need to a create
a new string to change the old one.

- Lists are "mutable" , you can change an element of a list using the 
index operator

- Dictionaries are a memory based key value store, they are associative arrays,most powerful data collection

- Unlike strings, dictionaries do not use indexes

- Tuples are immutable, just like strings, and thus can be more efficiently stored by python

- as a result you cannot sort, add, or reverse tuples

- Dictionaries and tuples go hand in hand, literally !!! as a dictionary is comprised of tuples

- Lists are a sequence, tuples are a sequence and even a string is a sequence so stuff like max() methods work on them
