# Machine Learning
---
Can be broken into:-
1. Supervised Learning - We are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like     
    a. Classification -we are instead trying to predict results in a `discrete output`. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.  E.g  Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.   
    b. Regression -we are trying to predict results within a `continuous output`.We are trying to map input variables to some continuous function E.g 1Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture .E.g 2 Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.     
2. Unsupervised Learning - 
    1. Recommender systems, which involve grouping together users with similar viewing patterns in order to recommend similar content.
    2. OR in my case group together failures with similar reporting code patterns
