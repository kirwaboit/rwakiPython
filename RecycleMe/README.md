---

### Problem Statement
- The world is inundated with trash 
- There is no fun ana exciting way to ensure trash is recycled because :-
    - There is no financial incentive to recycle
    - Recycling is very cumbersome , you need special trashcans, it's a big hassle and needs to be simplified
    - very little choice in what you want to recycle, some just want to start a little at a time
    - No Impact insentive to help maintain loyalty


### Solution and Bussiness idea
- Create a system that makes it easy fun and  rewrding to recycle trash

### process flow: overview
- A patron  logs onto website and creates an account, with email address and their home address(for pickup purposes)
- chooses what type of trash they want to recylce and what container they would like to send it in
- Wait for a few business days to recieve the containere , fill it up with recyclbl;e material and hit notify on the app that theyr ready for a pickup, put it outside their door and forget about it!


### How we make this fun and rewarding
- Deliver a monthly impact statement telling them how much trash they have recycled and how much of an impact they have had on the enviroement to some good detail
- Provide adequate compasation to  make them want to come back
- Sell phone app to schedule pickups
- Allow user  to create teams, groups or guilds. Also allow access to ranked leaderboards for those who want to be super competetive

### Process flow : Detailed MVP(minimal viable product)

TODO: Next steps
- Financial feasibility: 
    - Need to create simple website and try this out on friends see if we can make money out of it, 
    - See what are the potential issues that can lead to a loss, can we sufficiently deal with those issues?, rank the issues from unimportant to critical
    - Scalability if it works , what happens when we get 10 people 50, 100, doing it, what are the challenges each time, what can we anticipate
