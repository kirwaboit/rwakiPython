# Time Series Analysis  

## Short description on Time Series Analysis  
- you have just one variable "time". It is usually the "independent variable"
- We sometimes need to deduce a function that describes how one variable relates to another, in this case "time" to other dependent variables.For this we need to understand time series analysis  
- Time series is a set of observations taken at specified times usually at equal intervals  
- It is used to describe the current/past behavior of the data AND to help predict the future dependent variable values in the future  

## Trends  
- Uptrends - when data indicates a pattern that is increasing over time
- downtrends - when data indicates a pattern that is decreasing over time
- stay steady trend - data shows a pattern that is neither noiticeably increasing nor decreasing over time
