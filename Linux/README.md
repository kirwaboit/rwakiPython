# Welcome to linux

- Red hat created in 1994

- RPM =   Red Hat Package Manager

- curl and wget both good for accessing web addresses and downloads and testign APIs, but wget is better for multiple  and large installations 

- Most popular Linux webservers :Apache and Nginx

- most popular Email servers : postfix, dovecot and sendmail.org

- most popular database servers :mariaDb, mysql, postgresql

- Mounting : 

  - The term "to mount" a filesystem in Linux refers back to the early days of computing when a tape or removable disk pack would need to be physically mounted on an appropriate drive device. After being physically placed on the drive, the filesystem on the disk pack would be logically mounted by the operating system to make the contents available for access by the OS, application programs and users.

  - A mount point is simply a directory, like any other, that is created as part of the root filesystem. So, for example, the home filesystem is mounted on the directory /home. Filesystems can be mounted at mount points on other non-root filesystems but this is less common.
